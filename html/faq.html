  <h2>General</h2>
  <h3>What is Doge Yip?</h3>
  <p>
    Doge Yip is a decentrialized microbloging service that reads encoded data from the dogecoin blockchain using client-side javascript.
  </p>
  <h3>What do I need to start using Doge Yip?</h3>
  <p>
    All you need is a dogecoin wallet and some dogecoin. I would suggest going to <a href="http://dogecoin.com/">dogecoin.com</a> to learn more about dogecoin.
  </p>
  <h3>How do I post a yip to Doge Yip?</h3>
  <p>
    Click on the Yip link in the navagation bar, type whatever 
    you want into the text field, and then send some dogecoin to 
    each of the generated addresses. Once finished the yip is 
    forever associated with the wallet that made the 
    transactions.
  </p>
  <h3>How do I assign a name to my wallet?</h3>
  <p>
    Click on the Set Name link in the navagation bar, type 
    whatever name you want into the text field, and then send 
    some dogecoin to the generated address. Once finished that 
    name is forever associated with the wallet that made the 
    transaction.
  </p>
  <h2>Technical</h2>
  <h3>What are the fees to send messages?</h3>
  <p>
    To send a message you must make a transaction to the 
    generated address. To do so you would send over 1 Doge to 
    the generated address and another Doge to a miner as 
    incentive to put your transaction into the block chain. Note 
    that the generated address has no known private key. Thus 
    sending a Doge to that address is equivalent to burning a 
    Doge.
  </p>
  <h3>What's the maximum message length?</h3>
  <p>
    There isn't a theoretical limit. Currently you are limited 
    by how many Dogecoins you have.
  </p>
  <h3>Won't this bloat the blockchain?</h3>
  <p>
    Potentially. But if a transaction amount is too small then no 
    miner should actually write it into the block chain. I would 
    think that it would produce no more bloat than the faucet sites.
